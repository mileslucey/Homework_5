# Pyber
## Summary
* A homework assignment for UC Berkeley's Data Analytics Bootcamp
* Analysis studies data from a hypothetical ridesharing application (Pyber) using Pandas and MatPlotLib
* The following conclusions can be reached from the analysis:
  * About two thirds of all rides and total fare value come from urban passengers
  * The average rural rider's ride tends to cost a lot, but rural riders only make up a small portion of overall riders
  * Even though rural and suburban rider fares make up almost 40% of total fares, rural and suburban drivers make up less than 20% of total drivers
### Files
* The "pyber.ipynb" Jupyter Notebook uses MatPlotLib to conduct a graphical analysis of the ride sharing application data
* The "city_data.csv" and "ride_data.csv" files in the "data" folder are the data files used in the Jupyter Notebook analysis
* All the PNG files in the "output" folder are the graphs created in the Jupyter Notebook 
## Specific Graphs Created
MatPlotLib is used to create the following graphs:
* One bubble plot showing the relationship between the following variables:
  * Average Fare ($) Per City
  * Total Number of Rides Per City
  * Total Number of Drivers Per City
  * City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)
* Three pie charts showing the following:
  * % of Total Fares by City Type
  * % of Total Rides by City Type
  * % of Total Drivers by City Type
